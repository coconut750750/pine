# pine Gatsby Example

Most of the boilerplate code provided by https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default

This is an example of how to use this as a React component in a Gatsby app. Its useage as a vanilla React
component should be mostly the same.

## Usage 
1. Install Gatsby 
`yarn global add gatsby-cli` or `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

2. Start the Gatsby server
Run `gatsby develop` from `gatsby-example/`


## Files of interest
 - `gatsby-example/src/pages/index.js` This should be a good example of how to add an this Elm component.

 - `gatsby-example/src/elm/` This contains the Elm component files. These are copied straight from `frontend/src/`

 - `gatsby-example/elm.json` File is also necessary, as it defines the necessary Elm libraries.  **This file is different from the one found in `frontend/src`. The `source-directories` field should be configured to your `src/elm` directory.**
